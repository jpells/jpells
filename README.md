- 👋 Hi, I’m @jpells (Jimmy)
- 👀 I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience, specializing in building high-performance web applications with Django. I'm passionate about clean code, efficient systems, and contributing to the open-source community.
- 🚀 I recently launched the beta of [Trinety](https://www.trinety.com) — the first management platform built specifically for individual net lease property owners. It helps investors track lease dates, manage documents, and monitor performance — all in one place.
- 🌱 I'm currently diving deep into Golang and building a micro-blogging platform called [JBlog](https://github.com/jpells/jblog) to solidify my understanding of the language.
- 🛠️ I'm proficient in a range of DevOps tools and technologies, including Ansible, Terraform, and Docker. I enjoy automating infrastructure, streamlining deployments, and optimizing systems for scalability and reliability.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially in web development, fintech, or creative Golang experiments.
- 📫 You can reach me through [my portfolio](https://jimmypells.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmypells/).
